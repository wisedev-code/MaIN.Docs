# **Getting Started with MaIN**  

Welcome to MaIN! This guide will help you get started, explore key features, and make the most of the system.

## **1. Install the CLI (Highly Recommended!)**  

Before you begin, it is **highly recommended** to download and install the **CLI tool**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Why?**  
- It helps you **test** different setups quickly.  
- You can **validate ideas** before writing full applications.  
- It can **automatically set important environment variables** (like `modelPath`).  

ðŸ“Œ **To Install:** Check out the [CLI page](#/doc/cli) for full details on installation and setup.  

ðŸ’¡ **Can I start without the CLI?**  
Yes! If you prefer, you can skip to the next section, but you will need to manually configure some settings.

## **2. Learn the Basics (Tutorial Section)**  

Familiarize yourself with MaIN by going through the [tutorial section](#/doc/tutorial).  

ðŸ”¹ **Key Notes:**  
- If you **didnâ€™t install the CLI** or **didnâ€™t set the `modelPath`**, youâ€™ll need to manually specify the model path using:  
  ```csharp
  chatContext.WithCustomModel("your-model", "/path/to/model");
  ```  
- You can also use one of the **integrations**, but most of them require an **API key** to connect.

## **3. Explore Advanced Examples**  

Once you're comfortable with the basics, dive into the **examples section** to see more **complex scenarios** and best practices.  

ðŸ”¹ **What youâ€™ll find:**  
- Multi-agent workflows  
- File processing in chat sessions  
- Custom model integration  
- Interactive chat behaviors

## **4. Experiment and Have Fun!**  

There are no boundaries â€” the only limit is your creativity!
ðŸ’¡ **Run your agent flow in real time:**  
If you've built a flow of agents, you can **test it live** using the **technological demo page**.  

ðŸš€ **To launch the demo:**  
```sh
mcli start-demo
```  

Go ahead and exploreâ€”**the sky is the limit!** ðŸŽ‰
