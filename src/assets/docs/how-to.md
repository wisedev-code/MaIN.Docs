# **Getting Started with MaIN**  

Welcome to MaIN! This guide will help you get started, explore key features, and make the most of the system.

## **1. Install the CLI (Highly Recommended!)**  

Before you begin, it is **highly recommended** to download and install the **CLI tool**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Why?**  
- It helps you **test** different setups quickly.  
- You can **validate ideas** before writing full applications.  
- It can **automatically set important environment variables** (like `modelPath`).  

ðŸ“Œ **To Install:** Check out the [CLI page](#/doc/cli) for full details on installation and setup.  

ðŸ’¡ **Can I start without the CLI?**  
Yes! If you prefer, you can skip to the next section, but you will need to manually configure some settings.

## **2. Learn the Basics (Tutorial Section)**  

Familiarize yourself with MaIN by going through the [tutorial section](#/doc/tutorial).  

ðŸ”¹ **Key Notes:**  
- If you **didnâ€™t install the CLI** or **didnâ€™t set the `modelPath`**, youâ€™ll need to manually specify the model path using:  
  ```csharp
  chatContext.WithCustomModel("your-model", "/path/to/model");
  ```  
- You can also use one of the **integrations**, but most of them require an **API key** to connect.
